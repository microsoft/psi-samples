# Hello World

This sample is the simplest possible starting point for creating a \\psi application. The application pipeline in this sample contains a single `Timer` component that generates a message each second, and a single `Do()` operator that prints "Hello World" to the console for each message generated by the timer, along with the __originating time__ of the message. 

Ensuring that this sample builds and runs correctly is a good way to verify that your development environment has been setup correctly.

## Setting up the project

To build \\psi applications, we recommend using [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/ "Visual Studio 2019") on Windows (the free, Community editions is sufficient). Under Linux, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We will build this sample application using the available [\\psi Nuget packages](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Using-via-NuGet-Packages). 

Follow these steps to set up the Visual Studio project:

1. First, create a simple .NET Core console app by going to _File -> New Project -> Visual C# -> Console App (.NET Core)_.

2. Add a reference to the `Microsoft.Psi.Runtime` NuGet package that contains the core Platform for Situated Intelligence infrastructure. You can do so by going to References (under your project), right-click, then _Manage NuGet Packages_, then go to _Browse_. Make sure the _Include prerelease_ checkbox is checked. Type in `Microsoft.Psi.Runtime` and install.

## Creating a pipeline

Let's begin writing the code by adding the neccesary `using` clauses at the top:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Psi;
```

A \\psi application consists of a pipeline (computation graph) that contains a set of components (nodes in the graph), connected via time-aware streams of data (edges in the graph). Let's start by creating the __pipeline__ object, which is responsible for starting and stopping the components, for running them concurrently, and for coordinating message passing between them. To create the pipeline, we use the `Pipeline.Create` factory method, like below:

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    // Create a pipeline
    var p = Pipeline.Create();
}
```

## Adding a source component

Now let's construct a source component to generate some messages in this pipeline. We'll create a `Timer` component with the `Timers.Timer` factory method. In this case, the first parameter in the call is the pipeline object `p` (a common pattern in \\psi when instantiating components inside pipelines) and the second parameter is the time interval to use when generating messages, in this case 1 second.

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    // Create a pipeline
    var p = Pipeline.Create();

    // Create a timer component that produces a message every second
    var timer = Timers.Timer(p, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
}
```

You may notice that the `timer` variable we've just created has the type `IProducer<TimeSpan>`. This object type indicates that the component emits a stream of `TimeSpan` messages, in this case. In general, streams are of a generic type (you can have a stream of any type `T`) and are strongly typed, and therefore the connections between components are statically checked. All messages, regardless of type, are automatically timestamped at origin with an __originating time__.

## Adding a stream operator

We will next apply a [stream operator](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Basic-Stream-Operators) called `Do()` to the output stream of our timer component, which executes a function for each message posted on the stream. In this case, the function to apply to each message is specified inline, via an anonymous delegate with arguments `(t, e)`, where `t` is the message payload and `e` is the message envelope. In this example, we will ignore `t` and simply use the __originating time__ specified in `e` to print a timestamped message to console for each message (note that \\psi messages are timestamped in UTC):

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    // Create a pipeline
    var p = Pipeline.Create();

    // Create a timer component that produces a message every second
    var timer = Timers.Timer(p, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));

    // For each message created by the timer, print "Hello world!"
    // along with the message's originating time.
    timer.Do((t, e) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{e.OriginatingTime}: Hello world!");
    });
}
```

Under the covers, each stream operator is backed by a component: in this case, the `Do()` extension method creates a `Do` component that subscribes to the `Timer` component. In reality, the pipeline we have just constructed looks like this:

![Example pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/SimplePipeline.png)

## Running and disposing the pipeline

Next we need to [execute the pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Pipeline-Execution), which can be done in a few different ways. Calling `p.Run()` will tell the pipeline to execute until all components have completed sending messages, and this is a blocking call. Running this pipeline will cause the timer component to start generating messages, which in turn are processed by the `Do` operators. In this case, since the timer component will emit an infinite number of messages, the application would continue to run indefinitely until the application was killed by the user. Instead, we will use the asynchronous `p.RunAsync()` command, which will start executing the pipeline and then immediately return. We will then wait for the user to strike any key, upon which we gracefully shutdown the pipeline using `p.Dispose()`:

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    // Create a pipeline
    var p = Pipeline.Create();

    // Create a timer component that produces a message every second
    var timer = Timers.Timer(p, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));

    // For each message created by the timer, print "Hello world!"
    // along with the message's originating time.
    timer.Do((t, e) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{e.OriginatingTime}: Hello world!");
    });

    // Run the pipeline, but don't block here
    p.RunAsync();

    // Wait for the user to hit a key before closing the pipeline
    Console.ReadKey();

    // Close the pipeline
    p.Dispose();
}
```

Try it out! Running this application should result in a "Hello World" message being printed to the console every second. Striking any key will close the application.
