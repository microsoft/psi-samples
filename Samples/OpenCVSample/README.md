# OpenCV Sample

This sample demostrates how to integrate OpenCV with Platform for Situated Intelligence. There are two projects in this sample:
  1) OpenCVSample.csproj is the main sample. It creates a webcam source and sends the images from the camera to OpenCV to convert them to gray scale.
  2) OpenCVSampleInterop is a C++ project that is used to interop between C# and OpenCV.

The OpenCVSample.Interop project is the interop layer between the sample (project OpenCVSample) and OpenCV.

## Additional Prerequisites

In order to build this project you will need OpenCV installed on your machine. OpenCV can be obtained [here](http://opencv.org/releases.html). The sample relies on version 4.1.1. You will need to set an environment variable named "OpenCVDir_V4" that points to your OpenCV installation. The path should be the root of OpenCV which contains the "sources" directory (along with the license). For instance, "D:\OpenCV-4.1.1\opencv".

You will also need to modify your Visual Studio installation to add the following components from the Visual Studio Installer:
* Workloads:
  * __Desktop development with C++__
* Individual Components
  * __MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (v14.xx, latest version)__
