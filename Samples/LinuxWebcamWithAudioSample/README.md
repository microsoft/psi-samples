# Webcam With Audio Sample

This sample captures an image stream from a webcam and an audio stream from a microphone. The log energy level of the audio stream is computed and fused with the image stream, and the resulting frames are displayed with the audio energy information overlaid on top of the displayed images. The sample builds and runs on Linux.
